## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew Fout. 

I am a software engineer. 

I am passionate about quality design and development in a world of noise. 

Great inventions are borne from the intersections of usefulness, efficiency, beauty, and longevity. 

Who does this software serve? What are their needs? How can we exceed their expectations?

Those are the questions I ask myself in each project. 

From museum sites to robust data-driven software, I am a flexible developer and life-long learner that strives to meet needs and is open to contribute new ideas in any field.
