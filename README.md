## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew Fout. 

I am a software engineer. 

I am passionate about quality design and development in a world of noise. 

Great inventions are borne from the intersections of usefulness, efficiency, beauty, and sustainability. 

Who does this software serve? What are they looking for? What are their needs? 

Those are the questions I ask myself in each project. 

From museum sites to robust data-driven software, I am a flexible developer that will meet needs and contribute new ideas in any field.
